### 2. Dedicated Workout Plan Editor (`components/WorkoutPlanEditor.tsx`)
- **Full-featured plan editor** with modal-based interface
- **Workout creation** within plans with week/day structure
- **Exercise addition** to workouts with detailed configuration
- **Real-time data management** with proper state handling
- **Modern iOS UX** with proper spacing, typography, and interactions

### 3. Enhanced Backend Service (`lib/workoutService.ts`)
- **Complete CRUD operations** for workout plans, workouts, and exercises
- **Update and delete methods** for all workout entities
- **Proper error handling** and data validation
- **Type-safe operations** with TypeScript interfaces

### 4. Exercise Library Population Script (`scripts/populate_exercise_library.js`)

5. **exercise_categories** - Exercise categorization

### Key Relationships
- Workout plans contain multiple workouts
- Workouts contain multiple exercises
- Exercises belong to categories
- All entities have proper foreign key relationships

## Usage Workflow

### For Admins
1. **Access the builder** at `/admin/workout-builder`
2. **Create workout plans** with detailed metadata
3. **Add workouts** to plans with week/day structure
4. **Add exercises** to workouts with proper configuration
5. **Manage existing content** with edit/delete capabilities

### For Users
1. **Browse available plans** in the fitness section
2. **Select personalized plans** based on fitness level and goals
3. **Follow structured workouts** with detailed exercise instructions
4. **Track progress** through the workout system

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- **React Native** with Expo Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Modern React patterns** with hooks and functional components
- **Consistent styling** with design system constants

### Backend
- **Supabase** for database and authentication
- **Type-safe operations** with proper error handling
- **Scalable architecture** for future growth
- **Real-time capabilities** for collaborative features

### Data Management
- **Proper state management** with React hooks
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Error handling** and user feedback
- **Data validation** and sanitization

## Migration from Placeholders

The system is designed to seamlessly replace placeholder plans:

1. **Review existing placeholders** in the database
2. **Create real plans** using the admin interface
3. **Add structured workouts** with proper exercises
4. **Test with users** to ensure quality
5. **Deactivate placeholders** once real content is ready

## Future Enhancements Ready

The system is built with extensibility in mind:

### Planned Features
