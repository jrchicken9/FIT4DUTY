# Booking Approval Workflow Implementation

## Overview

The Practice Test Booking System has been updated to implement a proper admin approval workflow. This ensures that all bookings require admin review before being confirmed, providing better control and oversight.

## Workflow States & Transitions

### Booking Status Flow
```
PENDING → APPROVED → CONFIRMED
   ↓         ↓
REJECTED   CANCELLED
```

### Status Definitions
- **PENDING**: Initial status after successful payment and waiver submission
- **APPROVED**: Admin has reviewed and approved the booking
- **CONFIRMED**: Final status - booking is fully confirmed and locked
- **REJECTED**: Admin has rejected the booking (with reason)
- **CANCELLED**: Booking was cancelled (failed payment, user cancellation, etc.)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Functions

#### `update_booking_payment` Function
- **Fixed**: No longer auto-confirms bookings after successful payment
- **Behavior**: Keeps booking in `pending` status after payment success
- **Purpose**: Ensures admin review is required before confirmation

#### Admin Approval Functions
- **`approve_booking`**: Changes status from `pending` to `approved`
- **`reject_booking`**: Changes status to `rejected` with reason
- **`confirm_booking`**: Changes status from `approved` to `confirmed`

### 2. Frontend Updates

#### Booking Service (`RobustBookingService`)
- Updated to work with pending status after payment
- Added status display helpers (`getBookingStatusText`, `getBookingStatusColor`)
- Improved capacity checking (only counts confirmed bookings)

#### User Bookings Page
- Enhanced status display with proper colors and icons
- Added separate sections for different booking statuses
- Shows rejection reasons when applicable
- Improved user experience with clear status messaging

#### Session Detail Page
- Updated success message to indicate admin approval is required
- Clear communication about the approval process

### 3. Admin Dashboard

#### Booking Approvals Page
- Shows all pending, approved, and rejected bookings
- Admin can approve, reject, or confirm bookings
- Detailed booking information including waiver and medical data
- Proper status filtering and management

## Implementation Files

### SQL Scripts
- `fix-booking-approval-workflow.sql` - Main implementation script
- `test-booking-approval-workflow.sql` - Testing and verification script

### Frontend Files
- `lib/robustBookingService.ts` - Updated booking service
- `app/practice-sessions/bookings.tsx` - Enhanced user bookings page
- `app/admin/booking-approvals.tsx` - Admin approval interface

## Usage Instructions

### For Regular Users

1. **Book a Session**
   - Fill out waiver form
   - Complete payment
   - Booking status: `PENDING`
   - Message: "Booking submitted for admin approval"

2. **Check Booking Status**
   - View bookings in "My Bookings" page
   - Status will show: "Pending Admin Review"
   - Wait for admin approval notification

3. **After Approval**
   - Status changes to: "Approved - Awaiting Confirmation"
   - Final status: "Confirmed" (after admin confirmation)

### For Admins

1. **Review Pending Bookings**
   - Access admin dashboard → "Booking Approvals"
   - View all pending bookings with full details

2. **Approve/Reject Bookings**
   - Click on booking to see full details
   - Choose "Approve" or "Reject"
   - Add notes/reason if needed

3. **Confirm Approved Bookings**
   - Approved bookings can be confirmed
   - Confirmation sends notification to user

## Database Schema Updates

### New Columns Added
- `admin_reviewed_by` (UUID) - Admin who reviewed the booking
- `admin_reviewed_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When the review occurred
- `admin_notes` (TEXT) - Admin's notes about the booking
- `rejection_reason` (TEXT) - Reason for rejection

### Indexes Created
- `idx_bookings_status` - For status-based queries
- `idx_bookings_payment_status` - For payment status queries
- `idx_bookings_admin_reviewed` - For admin review queries
- `idx_bookings_created_at` - For chronological ordering

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the test script to verify implementation:
```sql
\i test-booking-approval-workflow.sql
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create a new booking as a regular user
2. Verify booking status is `PENDING` after payment
3. Check admin dashboard shows pending booking
4. Admin approves booking (status → `APPROVED`)
5. Admin confirms booking (status → `CONFIRMED`)
6. User sees confirmed booking in their list

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only see their own bookings
- Admins can see all bookings through admin views
- Admin functions require proper authentication

### Status Transitions
- Only admins can change status from `PENDING` to `APPROVED`
- Only admins can change status from `APPROVED` to `CONFIRMED`
- Payment success no longer auto-confirms bookings

## Error Handling

### Payment Failures
- Failed payments set status to `CANCELLED`
- Users can retry payment if needed

### Admin Actions
- Proper validation of booking status before transitions
- Error messages for invalid state changes
- Audit trail of admin actions

## Notifications (Future Enhancement)

### Planned Features
- Email notifications to users on status changes
- Push notifications for mobile app
- Admin notifications for new pending bookings
- Automated reminders for pending reviews

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexes on status and date columns
- Efficient queries for admin dashboard
- Pagination for large booking lists

### Frontend Optimization
- Efficient booking loading and caching
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Proper error handling and retry logic

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Booking not showing in admin dashboard**
   - Check if booking status is `pending`, `approved`, or `rejected`
   - Verify admin view is properly configured

2. **Status not updating**
   - Check admin function permissions
   - Verify booking ID and admin user ID are correct
   - Check for any constraint violations

3. **Payment issues**
   - Verify payment status is being updated correctly
   - Check that booking remains in `pending` status after payment

### Debug Queries
```sql
-- Check booking status
SELECT id, status, payment_status, created_at 
FROM bookings 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check admin view
SELECT * FROM admin_pending_bookings;

-- Check function permissions
SELECT routine_name, routine_type 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name LIKE '%booking%';
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Automated Approval Rules**
   - Auto-approve based on criteria (e.g., returning users)
   - Risk scoring for manual review

2. **Enhanced Notifications**
   - Real-time notifications
   - SMS notifications
   - Calendar integration

3. **Advanced Admin Features**
   - Bulk approval/rejection

   - Approval time metrics
   - Rejection rate analysis
   - Capacity utilization tracking
