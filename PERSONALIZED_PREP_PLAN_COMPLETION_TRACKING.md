# Personalized PREP Plan Completion Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds tracking for personalized PREP plan completion to prevent users from being repeatedly prompted to complete the plan setup, while providing a way to redo the plan if needed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250108_add_personalized_prep_completion.sql`

Added two new fields to the `profiles` table:
- `has_completed_personalized_prep_plan` (BOOLEAN) - Tracks if user has completed the plan
- `personalized_prep_plan_completed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Records when the plan was completed

### 2. User Type Updates
**File:** `context/AuthContext.tsx`

Updated the `User` type to include the new fields:
```typescript
// Personalized PREP Plan Completion
has_completed_personalized_prep_plan: boolean;
personalized_prep_plan_completed_at: string | null;
```

### 3. Fitness Screen Logic Updates
**File:** `app/(tabs)/fitness.tsx`

#### Updated `handleSectionToggle` function:
- Now checks `user?.has_completed_personalized_prep_plan` before showing the modal
- Only prompts for personalized plan setup if user hasn't completed it
- Updated section toggle text to only show "(Complete Setup)" if plan is not completed

#### Updated `onPlanSelected` callback:
- Added logic to mark the personalized plan as completed in the database
- Updates both `has_completed_personalized_prep_plan` and `personalized_prep_plan_completed_at` fields

### 4. UserWorkoutDashboard Component Updates
**File:** `components/UserWorkoutDashboard.tsx`

#### Added new props:
- `hasCompletedPersonalizedPlan?: boolean`
- `onRedoPersonalizedPlan?: () => void`

#### Added "Redo Plan" button:
- Only shows when user has completed their personalized plan
- Allows users to redo their personalized plan setup
- Styled as a secondary button next to the "Start Training" button

#### Updated button layout:
- Changed from single button to button group layout
- Added styles for the new button arrangement
