## How to Add the Exercise Library

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Access Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor

2. **Run the SQL Script**
   - Copy the contents of `scripts/add_exercises_direct.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute the script

3. **Verify the Results**
   - The script includes a verification query at the end
   - It will show you how many exercises are in each category

### Option 2: Using Migration (Alternative)

If you have local Supabase running:

```bash
# Start local Supabase
npx supabase start

# Run the migration
npx supabase db push
```

### Option 3: Using Node.js Script (If RLS is bypassed)

```bash
# Run the comprehensive exercise library script
node scripts/populate_comprehensive_exercise_library.js
```

## Exercise Details

Each exercise includes:
- **Name**: Clear, descriptive exercise name
- **Description**: Brief explanation of the exercise
- **Category**: Which category it belongs to
- **Muscle Groups**: Target muscle groups (array)
- **Equipment Needed**: Required equipment (array)
- **Difficulty Level**: beginner, intermediate, or advanced
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step instructions for proper form

## Benefits for Admins

With this expanded exercise library, admins can now:

1. **Create Varied Workouts**: Choose from 50+ exercises instead of just 3
2. **Target Specific Areas**: Select exercises by muscle group or category
3. **Progressive Difficulty**: Use exercises of different difficulty levels
4. **Police-Specific Training**: Include exercises relevant to police work
5. **Balanced Programs**: Create well-rounded workout plans

## Exercise Categories Breakdown

| Category | Exercise Count | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Upper Body | 8 | Chest, back, shoulders, arms |
| Lower Body | 8 | Legs, glutes, calves |
| Core | 8 | Abdominal and core exercises |
| Endurance | 7 | Cardiovascular exercises |
| Agility | 4 | Speed and coordination |
| Police Specific | 4 | Police-relevant exercises |
| Recovery | 3 | Low-intensity recovery |
| Flexibility | 4 | Stretching exercises |
| Bodyweight | 4 | Bodyweight movements |
| Power | 4 | Explosive movements |

## Next Steps

After adding the exercise library:

1. **Test the Admin Interface**: Go to the admin workout builder and verify you can see all the new exercises
2. **Create Sample Workouts**: Build some workout plans using the new exercises
3. **User Testing**: Have users test the new workout options
4. **Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback on exercise variety and difficulty

## Troubleshooting

### RLS Policy Issues
If you encounter Row Level Security policy errors:
- Use the SQL script directly in Supabase dashboard (Option 1)
- Ensure you're logged in as an admin user
- Check that the RLS policies allow admin users to insert exercises

### Duplicate Exercises
The script uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicate entries, so it's safe to run multiple times.

### Missing Categories
If some categories don't appear, check that the category names match exactly in the database.

## Support

1. Check the Supabase logs for error messages
2. Verify your database connection
